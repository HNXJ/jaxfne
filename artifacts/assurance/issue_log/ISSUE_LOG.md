# jaxfne issue log

Open issues only. Closed entries (I-001…I-014, P-001…P-010, P-013..P-015, P-021..P-026) and
their verdicts are archived byte-for-byte at
`artifacts/archive/0.5.x/ISSUE_LOG_2026-09-27.md` and `artifacts/archive/0.5.x/issues_closed.md`.
A new issue takes the next free P-ID; a solved issue gets a resolution line, then moves to a dated
closed batch beside them (`artifacts/archive/0.5.x/issues_closed_<date>.md`, pinned write-once like
`issues_closed.md`; P-035 and P-036: `issues_closed_2026-10-20.md`; P-038, P-039, P-041 to P-044:
`issues_closed_2026-10-25.md`; from 0.5.8 the batches sit in `artifacts/archive/0.5.x/issues_closed/`,
P-037: `issues_closed_2026-10-26.md`).

Entry fields: date, type (`BUG` `FRICTION` `DOC` `PERF` `SCIENCE` `IDEA`),
area, observation, severity, minimal reproduction, expected, actual, evidence,
possible future change.

## Open

Entry P-040 comes from the whole-project scan of 2026-10-18 (six Haiku workers,
read-only; each line was re-opened and confirmed by the dispatcher unless marked inferred).

### P-040

- Date: 2026-10-18. Type: SCIENCE. Area: Destexhe 2009 lane. Severity: high.
- `destexhe2009/PREREG_P3.md:1` reads "draft, UNSIGNED — no scored run may use it";
  `CALIBRATION.md:3-4` scores E1-E4 against it (header "Verdict: OFF"), and its final section
  says E1 passes (:427) and scores the reserved seeds 4-8. `REPLICATIONS.md:12` says "no verdict
  yet" and "28 passed" (30 pass today).
- 2026-10-20 (release plan A3): CALIBRATION header and steps 1-6 marked unscored pilots (ruling
  2026-10-18), body verdicts too; REPLICATIONS row agrees. Closes with the lane's next prereg.
- 2026-10-26: the Destexhe prereg moves to 0.5.9 (scope freeze, Hamm 2026-10-25); the entry stays
  open into 0.5.9.
